# NumpyMultilayerPerceptron

A simple Python implementation of a fully connected feedforward artificial neural network designed to help you get a better feel for these types of machine learning algorithms. This post provides the implementation as well as the underlying maths. The MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets are used to check the correctness of the implementation.

You can find my post on the project [here](https://kaifabi.github.io/).
